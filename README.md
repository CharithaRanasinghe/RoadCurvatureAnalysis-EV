# RoadCurvatureAnalysis-EV
The power distribution to the rear wheels of EVs is decided by the curvature of roads that the vehicle travels during a trip. This simulation and analysis is done based on actual expressway data and calculating induvidual power distribution to the wheels, to investigate and improve the efficiency of EVs with respect to the road design and curvature
